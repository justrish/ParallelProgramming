# ParallelProgramming
This repository is just to demonstrate my parallel programming capability in different languages
MPI, OPENMP, OPENCL and CUDA are some parallel programming languages. I have good command each of this language.
To display any code it is required to have the permission to display, code organization and solution to an interesting problem.
I would be adding code samples handling varied problems in languages mentioned above.
